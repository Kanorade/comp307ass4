To run this application, ensure the key .vrp and .sol files to be read are in the "files" directory.

The file structure you see when you unzip the "Assignment 4 submission" file should be fine.

In terminal, run:

    java -jar vehicle-router-n80-k10.jar

After running the application, you'll find 4 solution files have been generated in the same directory
as the jar application. 2 solution files are produced for each heuristic processed. One is the
standard solution where the node IDs are consistent with the IDs provided in the .vrp file.
The other solution file has a file name ending in "-py". This file is primarily to be compatible
with main.py to be able to visualise the solution for the assignment report. You can choose to
ignore this.
